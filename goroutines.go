/*

A goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime.
It lets you run a function at the same time as the rest of your program.

Think of it like starting a new task without waiting for the previous one to finish.

if i want to run things concurrently or want to use multithreading we use ---> goroutines.

important --> so in go, if we use goroutines then it not run like traditional function. It first go to goroutine scheduler then from there it runs ->

						1. The Go runtime schedules the function to run in the background, in a new goroutine.

						2. The function runs concurrently, managed by the Go scheduler.

						3. The actual execution may happen on the same OS thread, a different thread, or even a different CPU core â€” depending on runtime needs.
